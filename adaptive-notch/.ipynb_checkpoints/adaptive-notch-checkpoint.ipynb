    "Here we use a form of unsupervised learning to implement an adaptive notch filter to remove large-amplitude sinusoidal interference at an unknown frequency. We then extend our design to handle cases in which the desired signal is contaminated by *multiple* sinusoids at different frequencies. Next we test our adaptive filter in a dynamic setting, in which the frequency of the contaminating sinusoid changes (slowly and linearly) with time. Finally, we use our adaptive filter as a sub-band processing unit in a four channel filter bank to remove sinusoidal interference present in each of the four octaves."
