    "Here we implement a four channel filter bank in MATLAB and use it to perform band-specific processing on audio. We use an octave band scheme, decomposing the input into two low frequency bands (1/8th of signal bandwidth), one medium band (1/4th of signal bandwidth), and a high band (upper half of signal bandwidth). For filter design we use MATLAB's firpr2chfb(n, fp), with filter order $ n = 31 $ and passband-edge $ fp = 0.40 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then test our design by using the filter bank as an *equalizer*. That is, we apply different gains to the four bands of an incoming audio file, emphasizing certain octaves relative to others."
